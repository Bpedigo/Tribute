					<h2 class="title">Standing Room Only at Ochoa Memorial</h2>
					<p>
						The Central Coast came together Tuesday to say good-bye to Jerrett Ochoa.

						Ochoa was a star water polo player at Righetti High School, one of the founders of what is now known as One Way Water Polo, and a friend to many people in the Santa Maria and Orcutt communities. He died suddenly of an enlarged heart at the age of 31 on Monday, May 21.

						“It was standing room only,” at Tuesday’s memorial celebration at the First Christian Church on South College in Santa Maria said Rob Knight — Ochoa’s friend and high school coach.

						“I got the chance to say a few words at the ceremony and, when I looked at the back of the room, I could see it was standing room only.” Knight said. “His passing was a shock. It’s a great loss. He had tons of friends. All of us in water polo felt incredibly close to him. He was just one of those big, friendly personalities who made friends everywhere he went.”

						“The church sits 600 people and the place was packed so I think there were at least 700 people there,” Bob Nelson said. Nelson (Righetti ’97) was one of Ochoa’s (Righetti ’98) many teammates and friends. “There was a cross section of the community out here today — business people, community, school, water polo. It’s fascinating to me how many people he touched. In his 31 years on the planet, Jerrett did more — touched more people — than most people do in 80 years.

						“My heart just goes out to Nicole,” Knight said of Ochoa’s fiancé Nicole Donati. “She owns a yoga studio and he was an instructor there. He had such a bright future, they had such a bright future together.”

						Ochoa was the key to Righetti’s first great water polo success. In his senior year Ochoa — a two-time Northern League MVP — led the Warriors to their first-ever CIF Southern Section finals. Although the team finished second, that set the stage for the Warriors who won CIF-SS championships in each of the next two seasons.

						After a successful college career at Cuesta, he returned to Santa Maria where he was instrumental in the development of the local youth program, the Polo Bears.

						“The Polo Bears started as a city program and we had a great turnout — probably 35 kids at the beginning,” said Knight. “Jerrett was one of the first coaches. He helped pick their name. Over the years, the program evolved. It was known as Far Western for a few years then became One Way Water Polo.”

						A number of Ochoa’s friends played water polo with or against him the day before he died.

						“He played masters polo at Paul Nelson (Aquatic Center) on Sunday — the day before he died — and he was fine,” said Knight. “It appears he passed in his sleep later that night.”

						“Jerrett was talking trash to these high school kids,” said Nelson. “He was telling them how he was going to beat them at the Righetti fundraising tournament that’s coming up. Everyone was laughing, having fun. Jerrett was just a larger-than-life kind of guy.”

						Ochoa and friends were preparing to play in a fundraising water polo tournament that’s set for Righetti High School this coming weekend.

						The tournament will still be played on Saturday and Sunday — it just has a new name.

						“It’s the Orcutt Ochoa Open,” said Nelson. “We’re calling it ‘The Triple O’ at this point. It will be a masters tournament at Righetti High and we’re going to create a scholarship as well so we can keep Jerrett’s spirit alive.”
